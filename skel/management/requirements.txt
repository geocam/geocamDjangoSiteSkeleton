# This is a pip requirements file

# If you have the geocamUtil app, these requirements will be installed
# when you run "manage.py installreqs".  This default version installs
# the collected requirements from the apps' requirements.txt files and
# the siteRequirements.txt file by including the auto-generated
# allRequirements.txt file, but you can do whatever you want.
