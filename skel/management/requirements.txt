# This is a pip requirements file

# If you have the geocamUtil app, these requirements will be installed
# when you run "manage.py installreqs".  This default version just
# installs the requirements of the apps within the site by including the
# auto-generated appRequirements.txt file, but you can do whatever you
# want.
