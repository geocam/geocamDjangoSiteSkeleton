Django Site Skeleton Generator
==============================

This repo contains a django-site skeleton generator. It is meant to be used with Geocam's django-app-skeleton_. It creates a framework for pulling in the applications created with the app-skeleton into a cohesive site. Our version is intended to be used by developers at NASA, much like the django-app-skeloton_.
