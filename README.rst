Django Site Skeleton Generator
==============================

This repo contains a django-site skeleton generator. It is meant to be used with Geocam's django-app-skeleton_. 
It creates a framework for pulling in the applications created with the app-skeleton into a cohesive site. 
Our version is intended to be used by developers of xGDS, much like the django-app-skeleton_.
